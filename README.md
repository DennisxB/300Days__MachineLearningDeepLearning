# My Journey of 300DaysofData in Machine Learning and Deep Learning ðŸš€

**ðŸŽ¯ Day 1 of #300DaysofData!:**

**Ordinary Linear Regression**:<br>
In my journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, today I learned and implemented Ordinary Linear regression, Parameter Estimation, Minimizing Loss and Maximizing Likelihoods along with the construction and implementation of simple Linear Regression from the book **Machine Learning From Scratch**  and also an explanation of Performance Evaluation for the Estimation of Deterministic Parameters and Maximum Likelihood  Estimation for Multiple Regression from Timothy Schulz. I hope you will find some time reading the topics and books mentioned.

**ðŸŽ¯ Day 2 of #300DaysofData!:**
 
**Linear Regression Extensions:**<br> 
Today, I learned how to construct and implement the Extensions of Linear Regression which includes Ridge Regression, LASSO Regression, Bayesian Regression and Generalized Linear Models(GLMs) from the book **Machine Learning From Scratch**. I revised Matrix Calculus; dealing with multiple parameters, multiple observations, multiple loss functions and also Bayesian Estimators and Performance Estimation for Random Variables. Below is a snapshot of Regularised Regression, Bayesian Regression and Possion Regression(GLMs) using Python and Numpy Library. I hope you will find some to go through the resources mentioned.

**ðŸŽ¯ Day 3 of #300DaysofData!:**

**Discriminative Classifiers**<br>
Today, I learned how to construct and implement Binary and Multiple Logistic Regression, The Perceptron Algorithm, and Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant from the book **Machine Learning From Scratch**. I also read a blog post on the Math and Gradient Descent implementation of Multiclass Logistic Regression in Python by Sofia Yang. Below is a snapshot of Binary and Multiple Logistic Regression, The Perceptron Algorithm, and Fisherâ€™s Linear Discriminant using Scikit Learn Library. I hope you will find some to go through the resources mentioned.
