# My Journey of 300DaysofData in Machine Learning and Deep Learning ðŸš€

**Day 1 of #300DaysofData!:**

**Ordinary Linear Regression**:<br>
In my journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, today I learnt and implemented about Ordinary Linear regression, Parameter Estimation, Minimizing Loss and Maximizing Likelihoods along with the construction and implementation of simple Linear Regression from the book **Machine Learning From Scratch**  and also an explanation of Performance Evaluation for the Estimation of Deterministic Parameters and Maximum Likelihood  Estimation for Multiple Regression from Timothy Schulz. I hope you will find some time reading the topics and books mentioned.
